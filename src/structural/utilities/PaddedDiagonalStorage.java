/**
 * A wrapper for the internal storage of

 * array.
 *
 * CompDiagMatrix's internal storage uses a jagged array, which makes summing
 * the columns quickly in MatrixUtils.isColSumOne() difficult. This class makes
 * the internal storage behave like a typical, padded diagonal matrix format.
 * See http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~dongarra/etemplates/node376.html for a
 * description of the format we are mimicking.
