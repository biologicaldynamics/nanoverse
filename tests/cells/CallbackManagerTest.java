          On the face of it, this looks nearly identical to a test

          update the layer indices as BehaviorCell does, this actually
          verifies the functionality of refreshDivisibility directly.
          It would be better to have a true mock cell layer that could
          confirm the appropriate calls were made and nothing more.
